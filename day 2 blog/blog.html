                <h2 class="main-title" >Sebastian Vettel's Career Switch</h2>
                <h4> posted 3h ago</h4>

                <div class="main-content">
                <p>Last summer, 4 time World Champion Sebastian Vettel announced that he would be retiring from Formula One at the end of the season.</p>
                <p>This marked the end of a legendary career; 122 podiums, 57 poles, 54 wins (we count Canada) and countless records. Many questioned what Vettel would do post F1. We can now exclusively announce that he's switching careers (literally). From the end of June, Seb will be a part of our team - request one of our hitmen, and I'm going to repeat this so it looks longer lol so, this marked the end of a legendary career featuring a whole lotta podiums, hella poles, bare wins and many broken records. Many questioned what SV would do after retiring. We can now exclusively announce that he's literally switching careers (get it, cos switches?)... From the end of June, Seb will be a part of our team - request one of our hitmen, and perhaps you will be serviced by the German legend himself - Sebastian Vettel.</p>
